The source code is organized in a package called jpass. This packages has other "sub-packages" where each achieves a particular feature of the application.

## 2.Brief description of what static testing is and why do you think it is important and relevant.

Static testing is a way of assessing code verification without executing the code itself. This type of testing aims to find the potential defects in the design of the software using strategies such as static analysis or code reviews.

Static analysis is relevant for the following reasons:
- Improved code readability and maintance since it enforces certain coding norms 
- Early fault detection 
- Improves system security 


## 3.Brief description of the static testing tool used in this assignment and how was it configured for your project. Your description must explain, e.g., why did you enabled or disabled any default configuration or bug pattern.

## 4.Brief description of the report produced by the static testing tool.

## 5.Brief description of the 5x2 randomly selected bugs.

## 6.Brief description of how those 5x2 bugs were addressed/fixed. Tip: provide examples before and after fixing those bugs.
